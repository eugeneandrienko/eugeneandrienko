Hello, my name is Eugene and I'm a Java developer with 6+ years
experience. But a long times ago I also worked in embedded industry â€” wrote
software for industrial controllers in local company in Saint-Petersburg.

Love to explore and improve complex software systems.

Good at Java, Linux, Docker, unit tests and SQL. My key principle is attention
to small but important details.
